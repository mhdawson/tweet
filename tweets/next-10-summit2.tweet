The Next-10 team is planning a mini-summit November 18 to do a deep
dive on Types for Node.js developers and on building single executable
binaries with Node.js. Full details in https://github.com/nodejs/next-10/issues/99.
If you have thoughts/opinions on these topics and want to help
Node.js continue to be successful we hope to see you there.
